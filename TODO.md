# Project TODO List

This file tracks the features that are planned but not yet implemented.

### High Priority
-   **Real-Time Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard to visualize the performance of paper trading strategies in real-time. This would show the current equity curve, open positions, and key performance metrics that update dynamically.
-   **More Data Integrations:** Expand the platform's data sources beyond `yfinance`.
    -   **Cryptocurrency exchanges:** Direct integrations with APIs from exchanges like Binance or Coinbase for real-time crypto data.
    -   **Economic data:** Integration with sources like FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data).

### Medium Priority
-   **Strategy Marketplace:** A marketplace where users can publish their public strategies. Other users could then browse, "subscribe" to, or copy these strategies to their own accounts.
-   **Social Trading Features:** Implement features that allow users to follow other traders on the platform, view their public strategies and performance, and "copy trade" them.
